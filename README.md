An introductory Web Development project made for building familiarity with JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

## Subprojects
This project is a collection of *subprojects*, each of which relates
to one tutorial on JavaScript/CSS/HTML (and other Web Dev. technologies).

#### descriptions of each subproject:
* clever_programmer (progress: 1hr/8hrs):
This is the first "Full Course" JavaScript tutorial I looked at. It seemed a little too basic and slow-paced, so I moved on to caleb_curry.
* caleb_curry (progress: ...): Second "Full Course" JavaScript tutorial. More advanced than clever_programmer and provides more thorough explanations of complex web development concepts.
